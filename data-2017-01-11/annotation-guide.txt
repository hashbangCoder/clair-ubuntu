### General Guidelines

This is both a guide for how to annotate, and instructions on what to annotate.
At a high level, the goal of this annotation is to create a link/edge from each
message to the 0+ messages that it is a response to.

### How to annotate

The line being linked will have green text. The line it is being linked to will
be highlighted. At the moment, the top line should be both green and highlighted.

  >> Try moving the green line down by pressing SHIFT + DOWN (OS X only) or 'v'.
  >> Now try moving it up with SHIFT + UP (OS X only) or 'c'.

Move the green line down a few lines and try moving the highlighted line with
UP and DOWN. Note that the highlighted line cannot go below the green line.

  >> Try creating a link by typing SHIFT + d (i.e. D).

Note that once linked, the text turns blue.

  >> Try removing the link by typing SHIFT + d again.
  >> Now re-create the link with 'd'.

Note that when typing lowercase 'd', at the same time as creating the link, the
green line is moved down one and the highlighted line is changed to be right
above it.

  >> Move the green line back up one
  >> Link a second line to this one using SHIFT + d
  >> Now press 'u' to undo all links for this line
  >> Hide the help information at the bottom by typing 'h'

Do not do it yet, but you can move between files in your list with / and \. Any
annotations will be saved when you change files, and recovered when you return.
To quit, type 'q'.


### Scenarios:

Find a tricky case not covered here? Note it and share it with everyone.

Message Responds to Multiple Previous Messages
  <Bashing-om> Maube a fault in your mirror ? Maybe wait a spell and see if the
               mirror syncs up with mother .. or change your mirror ?
  <lordcirth> Yes, the next thing to try would be switching mirrors
  <ShinyShoes> this could be the mirror problem, you're right

- Link <ShinyShoes> message to both of the previous messages.


User Responds to Messsage Multiple Times.
  <OerHeks> you might want to reask in #ubuntu-server
  <fels> Thanks -
  <fels> are they brutal to newbies :)

  <zxc_> I'm thinking of just locating it and then using MPV to open it
  <nacc> not sure i follow -- of course you have to know where the file is
  <nacc> oh you mean you want to do `locate ... | mpv` ?

  <tgm4883> If you know you aren't supposed to come here, then why did you?
  <ThePotato> because the other chat is broked
  <ThePotato> for the distro

- There are two extremes here:
- (1) Each message could stand alone as a response (e.g. <fels>)
- (2) The messages form one thought (e.g. <ThePotato>)
-
- In (1), link both messages from <fels> directly to the message from
- <OerHeks>. In (2), link the second message from <ThePotato> to the first
- message from <ThePotato>. The case with <nacc> is closer to (1), but is less
- clear.


User is Engaged in Multiple Conversations
  <henry> can anyone tell me how to install a new package on ubuntu 14.04?
  <thomas> Is it necessary to create a liveUSB drive to install ubuntu?
  <henry> you can also burn an .iso file to a cd to install

  <Onepamopa> does anyone know HOW to auto execute a command AFTER user login (Unity) ?
  <Onepamopa> or how to permanently disable mouse acceleration
  <dankan> let me tell you
  <dankan> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mouse_acceleration see the bit
           "disabling mouse acceleration"ty

- No need to ensure all of a user's messages are in a single graph. Only link
- <henry>'s second message to <thomas>'s message. In the example of <Onepamopa>
- it is less clear, but they should probably be linked as they form one overall
- problem.
-
- For <dankan>'s messages, you need to either:
- (1) Link both of them to the last message from <Onepamopa>
- (2) Link both of them to both of <Onepamopa>'s messages.
- 
- You should do (1) when <Onepamopa>'s messages formed a single question. Do
- (2) when they formed separate questions, but somehow were both answered at
- the same time.


Interjections / Noise
  <ctf2> ddd
  <ctf2> adasdaasddas

- Treat each as a separate interjection - do not link to anything.


Use of ubottu, an IRC bot:
  <karen_> hi, guys, I just got lubuntu 16.04, don't know it well, but I don't
           see anywhere to download "Skype". I looked in synaptic package and
           Lubuntu Software. What should I do?
  <OerHeks> !skype
  <ubottu> To install Skype on Ubuntu, see
           https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype - To record on Skype, check:
           https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SkypeRecordingHowto - Please use open
           protocols instead if you can, see !Ekiga

- Link ubottu's response to both the person who called it (<OerHeks>) and the
- person the information is directed at (<karen_>).
